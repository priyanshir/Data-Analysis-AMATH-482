# Data-Analysis-AMATH-482
Exploratory and objective data analysis methods applied to the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. Brief review of statistical methods and their computational implementation for studying time series analysis, spectral analysis, filtering methods, principal component analysis, orthogonal mode decomposition, and image processing and compression
* Homework 1: An Ultrasound Problem - detected the location of a marble in the dog, using Fourier Analysis
* Homework 2: Gabor Transforms: Find what notes are being played using the Gabor Transform and Spectrograms
* Homework 3: PCA: track the location of a moving paint can, in different directions, and use SVD to find the ideal angle/direction to take the video (with least noise)
* Homework 4: Music Classification: Classified music into genres/by artists using SVD and projections
* Homework 5: Neural Networks for Classifying Fashion MNIST (Python): Trained model using Machine Learning libraries in Python to classify fashion images from the Fashion MNIST dataset
